# My Personal Website

### Description

This repository contains the code for my personal website, which I currently have a lot of mismatched plans for. The site is currently being built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [BulmaCSS](https://bulma.io/).\
Some things I'd possibly like on the site are:

- My software development portfolio
- A book review section
- A blog where I can write
- Pictures
- Music that I make / a music review section

### Road-blocks

_I will be documenting things that I struggle with here_

### Things I Learned

_I will be documenting major revelations that I have here_
