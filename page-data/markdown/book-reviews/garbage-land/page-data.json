Author Elizabeth Royte, a resident of New York City, begins by quantifying her own household trash (for which the U.S. averages 4.5 lbs per person, per day), picking through it to separate the detritus into categories. She then examines, first-hand, some of her city's processes for handling waste as she learns about the more general state of affairs for dealing with refuse.\n<br />\n<br />\nI had this book on my list for simply because I was curious about the destination of my trash. I wasn't shocked by too many of the specifics (most stuff gets buried, while what can be recycled is processed in dedicated facilities), but I admit that I had no idea how privatized all of this was. We leave the free market to take care of even the things we don't want: forgotten toys, clothes, decaying food, and even our poop and pee. Of course, this means that industry practices are dictated by what is profitable, not what is most efficient or least impactful on the environment.\n<br />\n<br />\nA landfill is a place filled with a countless assortment of items. Some aid the natural process of decay, while others take thousands of years to break down. These dumps release methane into the air and leachate (contaminated moisture) into the soil. There are ways to control these byproducts, but the corporations that control the sites aren't very interested in best practices. They also tend to force landfills on poor communities that they tempt with hefty sums of cash. Citizens of these communities end up with higher rates of asthma and other diseases induced by the pollutants outgassing from the fills.\n<br />\n<br />\nPeople want to be eco-conscious citizens, Royte believes, citing the increased sales of \"green\" products and services. There are myriad reasons for recycling paper until it cannot weather the process any longer (after about 4 cycles, the fibers become too short to be used in things like cardboard): Trees are not cut, oil is not used in logging, water and electricity are not used for wood pulping, and the materials are not sent directly to a landfill. Recycled metal cuts air pollution 85% and water use 40%. Even sewage can be refined into \"biosolids\", a nitrogen rich fertilizer. But despite these creative solutions to conserving materials for future use, municipal waste still accounts for only 2% of the national amount. Every 100 pounds of product generates 3200 pounds of waste.\n<br />\n<br />\nThe \"hierarchy of waste\", Royte concludes, is <strong>reduce consumption</strong> > <strong>reuse consumer goods</strong> > <strong>recycle/compost the rest</strong>. We should spend less time trying to figure out how to get rid of things, she thinks, and instead not put ourselves in the position of getting rid of them in the first place. The path forward is not towards better products, but fewer products, something that may not be realized without sweeping changes to the structure of this consumerism-fueled country.\n<br />\n<br />\n<em>Garbage Land</em> answered many of the questions I had about trash, but a footnote that I'll add is that it was published in 2005. There's the possibility that much has changed since then, so I'll look into it. I also couldn't help but thinking that this book would have been much better as a documentary. I was lost by much of the imagery surrounding machines I didn't understand and operations I couldn't imagine. But, in 2005, before everyone watched Netflix, a book might have been a more powerful way of reaching a wide audience. Much has changed in so little time.\n<br />\n<br />\n\"Emptiness - cleanliness - was a condition so brief as to be nearly undetectable.\"</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Garbage Land","date":"2020-09-20"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/markdown/book-reviews/garbage-land/"}}}
