Sarah Bakewell is an excellent biographer, and she manages to adequately cover the lives of several very complex figures in the space of just a few hundred pages.\n<br />\n<br />\nI was immediately hooked when I first read the descriptions of the ways that early existentialists in France would go about their days, hanging out in cafes to debate philosophical ideas and later attending jazz clubs to dance, drink, and chat. At these clubs,\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>\"...they would admit anyone 'so long as they were interesting - that is, if they had a book under their arm.'\"</b>\n<br />\n<br />\nThis is all very indie. The existentialists were a creative bunch, constantly reading, writing, making music, and dancing. They were the type of people that you can count on having late-night intellectual talks with. I'm in. I wanna hang out with these people.\n<br />\n<br />\nAnyhow, this book starts off with Sartre becoming interested in the German idea of phenomenology, which becomes the basis for existentialism. While Plato \"puzzles about whether things are real or how we can know anything for certain about them,\" phenomenology simply asks us to consider things \"as they are,\" or the way in which we experience them. This still allows for a huge degree of complexity: With this perspective, a cup of coffee can be a very phenomenon during each moment of its existence. When it is being carried to you on a tray, you associate it with the feeling of anticipation. When it is steaming, you refrain from bringing it to your lips. When it is nearly empty, you may begin to want more.\n<br />\n<br />\nSartre furthered this idea by describing how the presence of other <em>people</em> affects our experience. Upon being observed, we experience a radical shift in whatever it is that we are doing at the moment. He uses the example of peering through a keyhole into someones room. You might know why you are doing this, but the appearance of an observer forces you to assume all sorts of identities that may or may not be relevant to the truth of what you were doing. W.E.B. Du Bois used a similar idea when describing the struggle of the African American community:\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>\"...this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity.\"</b>\n<br />\n<br />\nI was most interested in Sartre's commentary on Kirkegaard's famous idea that \"anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.\" Sartre revolutionized what is meant by the term \"freedom.\" He thought that we tend to create pretend rules in life that give us the illusion of necessity - \"guardrails against anguish.\" (This reminds me of Yuval Harari's thesis in Sapiens, which is that humans create inter-subjective \"myths\" to delude them about their lives' meaning). Sartre famously said that living in \"bad faith\" meant that you assume a role and act as if you are trapped in it. That's wrong because we possess the ability to make decisions and change our situations.\n<br />\n<br />\nThis might seem absurd, as any reasonable person knows that we all have to deal with all sorts of preexisting conditions that can make life pretty hard and inflexible. Sartre didn't deny this. Rather, he said that \"good faith\" is exercising freedom out of your preexisting situation. Some individuals may be lucky enough for this to mean that their lives are full of choices and devoid of external pressures and constraints. Others not so much. Even a prisoner of war (which Sartre was during WWII) has the freedom with which to react to their situation. Maybe this last point is debatable, but <em>no one can control our internal reactions to external input</em>.\n<br />\n<br />\nI mainly like this idea because it is empowering, and it provides a much better reference point than the traditional schools of philosophy. I'm tired of trying to figure out whether I'm real or not. I'd rather presuppose the elusive nature of reality to be irrelevant to the practical things I can do to improve my life.\n<br />\n<br />\nThis outlook was the most fascinating thing I came across in this book, and I endeavored to learn a bit more about it through one of Sartre's novels, <em>Nausea</em>. I'm not going to go into the rest of the philosophers in this, but there is a lot to be said about each of them - not just their ideas. Bakewell, at the end of the book, says this:\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>\"When I first read Sartre and Heidegger, I didn't think the details of a philosopher's personality or biography were important. This was the orthodox belief in the field at the time, but it also came from my being too young myself to have much sense of history. I intoxicated myself with concepts, without taking account of their relationship to events and to all the odd data of their inventors' lives. Never mind lives; <em>ideas</em> were the thing. Thirty years later, I have come to the opposite conclusion. Ideas are interesting, but people are vastly more so.\"</b>\n<br />\n<br />\nWe can't detach our ideas from our experience, and to me, that's what existentialism is all about. We're like play-doh, constantly being pushed and pulled from all sorts of angles, and whatever we are at the moment is result of the entire sequence of those influences. If you read this book, try to consider how each of the philosophers arrived at their conclusions. And try to figure out how you've reached your own conclusions in your life. How can you begin to notice the experiences that shape you? And how can you use this information to gain a broader and more empathetic worldview?\n<br />\n<br />\nRelated books I want to read after reading this one:\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>The Second Sex</b>, by Simone de Beauvoir\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>She Came to Stay</b>, by Simone de Beauvoir\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Being and Nothingness</b>, by Jean-Paul Sartre\n<br />\n<br />\nFavorite quotes from \"At the Existentialist Cafe\":\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>\"Few people will risk their life for such a small thing as raising an arm - yet that is how one's powers of resistance are eroded away, and eventually one's responsibility and integrity go with them.\"</b>\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>\"She [Beauvoir] would leave the library each afternoon feeling a radiant sense of the rightness in all things - a feeling that lasted for about five minutes before the city's grubby reality brought it down.\"</b>\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>\"When he [Merleau-Ponty] looks for his own metaphor to describe how he sees consciousness, he comes up with a beautiful one: consciousness, he suggests, is like a 'fold' in the world, as though someone had crumpled a piece of cloth to make a little nest or hollow.
