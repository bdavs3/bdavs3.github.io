Since I wanted to get used to React, I landed on <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">GatsbyJS</a> as the best tool for what I wanted to accomplish. All in all, I am really impressed by the simple, yet elegant, possibilities that this framework offers. I'll definitely be using it again.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it's pretty hard for a project to serve both as a vessel for learning and as a finished product that satisfies all of the original goals set forth. I ended up spending such a long time creating the <a href=\"/book-review\">Book Review</a> page that I never quite got to some of the other things I wanted to implement. Ultimately, I decided it'd be best to publish this site, though minimally built out, and take a stab at some of the other things I wanted to get to (music review, portfolio, etc.) in future iterations. Now that I know a lot more about Gatsby, it would be fun to start from the ground up again.</p>\n<p>The source code is available <a href=\"https://github.com/bdavs3/my-website\">here</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome to my Website","date":"2020-08-31"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/markdown/blog-posts/welcome/"}}}
