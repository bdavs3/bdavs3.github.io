It took me a while to figure out how I wanted to approach this book review. I read a lot of different things, and each provides for a different experience. If I'm being candid, some experiences I wish to write about much more than others. I ultimately decided that rating everything I read is a futile exercise. I'd rather analyze things that are worth analyzing.
<br />
<br />
The point of writing about what I read is two-fold: 1) I want to share with you something about the book in case you'd like to check it out yourself and 2) it helps bring the most profound elements of what I've read to the surface of my attention.
<br />
<br />
This enables the format of this book review to be really free-form. I won't write about every single thing that I read. But I will make sure that what I do write about is meaningful. I'll do this through a combination of summary, analysis, and maybe some other things that haven't yet crossed my mind. There will inevitably be spoilers, but I'll always make sure to let you know when they're coming.
