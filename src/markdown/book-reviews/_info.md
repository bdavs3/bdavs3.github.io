My goal in designing a book rating schema was to make it extremely expressive. At first, I thought I'd have to institute a system with lots of flexibility, allowing for a large range of possible ratings. But, I started to feel that this proliferation of available rating values would in fact reduce the meaning of any rating. I realized that a simple rating system, paired with adequately involved explanations, would be much more accessible. I will do my best to ensure that these explanations suffice to describe the scope of any rating. So, here's my attempt at a schema that requires me to assiduously weigh my thoughts on a book and, in consequence, supplies my readers with useful information about whether they ought to consider reading it.

A one-star book is something that, in general, I would not recommend to others to read. In conversation, I would be unlikely to bring it up, even when discussing a topic relevant to its subject matter. There may be a chapter or section that is thought-provoking / entertaining. But, overall, I find that it lacks long-standing value and I failed to absorb anything truly meaningful from it.

A two-star book is something that I would likely discuss with others. In it, there are moments of deeply complex insight interleaved by less significant commentary. To me, it was worth reading and helped increase my familiarity with a subject. Some portions may have left me confused or in disagreement with the author, but overall, I benefitted significantly from its content. I probably wouldn't read it again, but I'd encourage others to check it out, especially if they are interested in the subject.

A three-star book is masterfully written, cover to cover, and leaves me in awe at some of the knowledge I've gleaned from it. It either encourages me to live my life a little differently or see the world in a new way. I would gladly read it again or at least check out other works by the author. My interest in the subject matter greatly increases as the result of reading a three-star book. Unsolicited, I may tell others about the book and encourage them to get their hands on a copy.
