Tara Westover's childhood is shaped by a ruthless father and acquiescent mother. Before the main text begins, we read a disclaimer that the book is not about Mormonism. But Mormonism is what Tara's father, Gene, draws upon in any of the instances when he shames Tara for being a whore, denies medical care and education to his children, or blames the government for an array of conspiracies against honest, god-fearing citizens like himself. My instinct is that Tara included this disclaimer not to ironically condemn Mormonism, but rather to separate people like her father from those who don't use faith as an excuse for contemptible or illogical action.

<br />
Many of us go through life wishing to be different than everyone else so that we can stand out as an icon in a cookie-cutter society. At least I do. Technological advances brought us social media, which does little more than to make us wish we were one of the people that gets endless validation for everything they do. But as for the people doing all the validating... few of them will ever stand out. Tara never had to choose to be different. Her circumstances, built on survivalist and extremist foundations, immediately separated her from any other person she could ever hope to meet. This is why her outlook on dance class is interesting to me:
<br/>
<br/>
<b>"I loved the sensation of conformity. Learning to dance felt like learning to belong."</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Conformity has never sounded appealing to me, yet somehow it makes sense why Tara's instinct is to want to blend in. Maybe conformity becomes appealing when you begin to notice the drawbacks of being different. For Tara, there was never anything <em>but</em> drawbacks to it.
<br />
<br />
Tara's quest to get an education was indeed difficult, but one of the hardest parts about it was having to <em>unlearn</em> the things she had absorbed throughout her corrupted childhood. She attempted again and again to pardon her abusive brother's physical and emotion torture. When she finally reached the "real world", she began to wonder if her family was right. At BYU, she met Mormons who weren't genuinely adhering to the strictures of the faith. As a loving individual, she constantly sought signals that her family was correct and that the masses were wrong.
<br />
<br />
I don't believe there are many who can relate to Tara's external environment. But her internal struggle is all too familiar. Whether we know it or not, we constantly try to adapt to incoming information from all kinds of sources. There is an intrinsic bias attached to some of the most prominent of these sources, one of which is family. It is exceedingly difficult to disregard the counsel of family members that have been surrounding you for most of your life.
<br />
<br />
How do we know what is right and what isn't? At what point do we decide to abandon our trust in our loved ones? These are interesting questions, and as Tara matured and gained exposure to the world, I think she realized that they are intended to be answered internally. Education is the process of discovering your answers to life's difficult questions and learning how to approach them with ever increasing wisdom.
<br />
<br />
In an interview with Tara that I found on Youtube, she said this:
<br/>
<br/>
<b>"An educated person is not someone that can recite an army of facts and knows a lot of things, but rather it is someone that has the flexibility of mind. Someone that is willing to explore her own prejudice and has acquired a depth of understanding that allows her to see the world through another point of view."</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, I also recently came across the other quote from Vitalik Buterin (the creator of the cryptocurrency Ethereum), which strongly reminded me of Tara's:
<br/>
<br/>
<b>"Education is ultimately much more than simply memorizing individual facts or even learning individual concepts. What matters most: learning how to think, learning how to reason, and learning how to learn."</b>
<br/>
<br/>
It is this emphasis on process over result that I believe enables individuals to fully reach their potentials.
<br />
<br />
Favorite quotes from "Educated":
<br/>
<br/>
<b>"He said he loved me but this was over his head. He couldn't save me. Only I could. I had no idea what he was talking about."</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>"'I can stand in this wind [on the roof], because I'm not trying to stand in it,' I said. 'The wind is just wind. You could withstand these gusts on the ground, so you can withstand them in the air. There is no difference. Except the difference you make in your head."</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>"But vindication has no power over guilt. No amount of anger or rage directed at others can subdue it, because guilt is never about <em>them</em>. Guilt is the fear of one's own wretchedness. It has nothing to do with other people. I shed my guilt when I accepted my decision on its own terms, without endlessly prosecuting old grievances, without weighing his sins against mine. Without thinking of my father at all, I learned to accept my decision for my own sake, because of me, not because of him. Because I needed it, not because he deserved it."</b>
