With "Skippy Dies," Paul Murray drags---no, hurls-- the fusty genre of the boys' boarding school novel into the 21st century. As always, there are troubled or befuddled adolescents; clueless or hapless teachers; blinkered administrators intent on preserving moribund traditions to decorate the flyers of the next capital campaign. And as always there are predatory upperclassmen and mysterious girls going to and fro in the sister school next door.

<br />
Now give these teenagers cell phones, video games, computers, and a voracious appetite for pills of all sorts. Make the boarding school a Catholic one, with secretive priests, and set it in pre-slump go-go Dublin. And, not least of all, in the first chapter kill off the protagonist in a doughnut shop, thus setting up an excellent mystery.

"Skippy Dies" made the 2010 Booker Prize long list, and it's a pity it didn't win. Murray has an unerring eye for the sufferings of 14-year-old boys and the fecklessness of middle-aged teachers. "Skippy" is a long novel that moves back and forth between various characters. It isn't perfect; there's a bit too much time spent on the scientific speculations of Skippy's roommate, Rupert, as well as on the video games that Skippy himself plays. However, the novel moves briskly along, for the most part, complete with a Gotterdammerung ending that actually seems apt.

I'm recommending this to all of my teacher friends. School principals can read it if they dare. And if you're a parent of a teenager (or ever have been), you'll find "Skippy Dies" riveting.
