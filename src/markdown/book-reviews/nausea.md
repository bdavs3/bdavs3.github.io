I picked up this book while reading <em>At the Existentialist Cafe: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails</em> (which I also reviewed) because Sarah Bakewell said that it is one of her favorite books. She loved the protagonist Antoine de Roquentin and his pensive wandering about the French seaside, and that sounded like something I would also be into.
<br />
<br />
Maybe it's because I overdosed on existentialism, but I didn't like this book as much as I thought I would. I typically don't read fiction, but I was interested to read some original material from Sartre. This novel makes a hard attempt at being profound (as does most stuff written by philosophers), and perhaps that not exactly what strikes my fancy. I love profundity as much as the next guy, but I enjoy when it is packaged in clever or subtle ways (this is why I love Paul Murray so much).
<br />
<br />
There isn't a whole lot that actaully <em>happens</em> in <em>Nausea</em>. It's essentially a long soliloquy in which we hear a great deal about Roquentin's depression and struggle to cope with the absurdity of life. Pretty relatable, but it got old for me. I was diligent in taking notes and outlining important passages for the first half of the book, but after that point, I basically powered through until the end because I was ready to move onto something else.
<br />
<br />
Still, this is probably Sartre's most important work aside from <em>Being and Nothingness</em>, so if you dig existentialism, you'll probably want to give it a read. At 178 pages, it is very bearable. Just remember that this is a translation, was written in 1938, and lacks extensive dialogue, so you won't be able to breeze through it like you would with other books of similar length.

Favorite quote:
<br />
<br />
<b>"I have never had adventures. Things have happened to me, events, incidents, anything you like. But no adventures. It isn't a question of words; I am beginning to understand. There is something to which I clung more than all the rest - without completely realizing it. It wasn't love. Heaven forbid, not glory, not money. It was... I had imagined that at certain times my life could take on a rare and precious quality. There was no need for extraordinary circumstances: all I asked for was a little precision. There is nothing brilliant about my life now: but from time to time, for example, when they play music in the cafes, I look back and tell myself: in old days, in London, Meknes, Tokyo, I have known great moments, I have had adventures. Now I am deprived of this. I have suddenly learned, without any apparent reason, that I have been lying to myself for ten years. And naturally, everything they tell about in books can happen in real life, but not in the same way. It is to this way of happening that I clung so tightly."</b>
