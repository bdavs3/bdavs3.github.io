Dr. Greene is an outstanding writer who explains the complex theories and hypotheses of String/M Theory and research into the very fabric of space and time. This book is an effort to put into terms at a layman's level, the very complex research going on today at places across the globe attempting to discover the fundamental makeup of the universe. For the most part Dr. Greene succeeds in his effort to make this intensely complex subject understandable.

<br />
Written as a further investigation that was begun with his book The Elegant Universe, in The Fabric of The Cosmos, Dr. Greene leads the reader on a expedition into the darkest corners of the universe exploring the fundamental building blocks of time and space, reality and imagination, and the arrow of time and why it appears to us to have but one direction. A String Theorist, Dr. Greene's explanations weigh heavily in that direction, but he does make inroads into other theories such as Loop Quantum Gravity and their position in the entire scope of research going on today.

As new experiments are conducted at facilities such as The Large Hadron Collider at CERN or at Fermilab in this decade, it will be interesting to see if Dr. Greene's hypotheses come to fruition or if entirely new paths may open in the search for a Unified theory of the quantum realm and Gravity. In the meantime, if you have an interest in Theoretical Physics, but lack the formal training necessary to understand it on a mathematical level, I recommend Dr. Green's book.
