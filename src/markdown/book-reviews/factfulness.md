<em>Factfulness</em> is a book that focuses on the discrepancy between the actual state of the world and how people perceive it. Author Hans Rosling was putting the finishing touches on this work shortly before he died in 2017. He earnestly wanted to share his insights with humanity before departing, and with the help of son Ola Rosling and daughter-in-law Anna Rosling Ronnlund, was successful in doing so.
<br />
<br />
The book centers on a set of questions that become the basis for which Hans's built the <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/">Gapminder</a> foundation: things like "What is the life expectancy in the world today?" and "Worldwide, 30-year-old men have spent 10 years in school, on average. How many years have women of the same age spent in school?" Even when supplying just three multiple choice options, Hans found that almost everyone he interviewed scored worse-than-random on this assessment. Their answers were indicative of an overly-negative worldview that disparages much of humanity's progress in recent years. Remarkably, a person's level of education had no correlation with performance.

If you are like me, the first portion of this book should make you somewhat angry. It seems that the author undermines many of the important issues pressing the world today. But, as you go further, you'll realize that Rosling's fact-based perspective is refreshing. As a trained medical professional, he spent his entire life attempting to help others. He didn't hesitate to expose himself to disease or hardship in order to supply aid, and he had an indelible positive impact on a great many communities. In doing so, he learned to resist several "instincts" that distort humans' ability to think clearly.

<b>"They sometimes call my lectures 'inspirtational' and many people also say they have a comforting effect. This was never my intention. But it's logical. What I show is mostly just official UN data."</b>
<br />
<br />
Data is definitely Rosling's closest ally. It shows that things can be "bad, but still getting better". It reminds us which issues are actually the most important. It can stop us from making horrible, knee-jerk decisions. Data is what reminds us that the world was much, much different as recently as a few decades ago.
<br />
<br />
One of the flagship viewpoints in <em>Factfulness</em> is that the tendency to group things in a binary fashion ("us" vs. "them", "rich" vs. "poor", "developing" vs. "developed") is not a sustainable habit to take into the future. As such, he divides income into four levels. Well-to-do countries like his native Sweden are largely made up of Level 4 families, but he reminds us that as recently as a few decades ago, Sweden was much more of a Level 3 nation. And before that, Level 2. In the same way that "Western" countries moved up the income levels, so-called "developing" nations are as well.

I highly recommend this book, especially if you are trying to educate yourself about today's most important global issues. It is a relatively quick read and remains interesting throughout. Towards the end, look out for Rosling's Top 5: the things that he thinks could actually lead to doomsday.
