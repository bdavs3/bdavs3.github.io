In <em>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</em>, Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (quite the mouthful of a name - I will refer to him as "M.C." hereafter) synthesizes decades of psychological research into what he believes to be a comprehensive theory of happiness. He describes "flow states" as experiences that involve complete immersion into the present moment. These states sometimes manifest naturally in our lives when we plug away at a task, free of distraction and completely focused on what we are doing. People describe flow states as being free of all anxiety, filled with immense enjoyment, and even associated with a distorted sense of time. M.C. offers that life itself may be thought of as a potential flow experience, capable of providing the type of fulfillment that humans constantly struggle to attain.

Humans are capable of absorbing roughly 126 bits of information per second, which could lead to an accumulation of 185 billion bits in an entire lifetime. But, the author points out, many people opt to spend their time in the pursuit of pleasure or the satisfaction of surface-level desires which do not fully challenge their minds to grow and become more "complex". In addition, in moments where they have the opportunity to focus on a task or goal that is meaningful to them, they become distracted by technology, negative thoughts, or a whole array of other things.

The goal of <em>Flow</em> is to underscore how we may go about decreasing "psychic entropy", the result of existential dread that is difficult to mitigate using even the superfluous resources of modern society. Akin to the way a dissipative structure - "a physical system that harnesses energy which would otherwise be dispersed or lost in random motion" (such as a plant, which organizes scattered light rays into useful energy) - creates order out of disarray, our minds can learn to create order out of the haphazard experiences of life.

The idea of flow is extremely powerful to me. It drew me to this book, as I desired to understand more of its facets and figure out how it can be leveraged in my own life. M.C. is adamant that the influence of external factors on the quality of subjective experience can be greatly reduced by individuals with fantastic control over their consciousness. This reminded me of Frankl's <em>Man's Search for Meaning</em>, from which it is evident that the human mind is capable of prescribing meaning even to horrific events such as the Holocaust. I feel confident in the author's supposition that control over the mind's processes is a skill - like any other - that can be practiced and perfected. Flow is accessible to anyone, regardless of living situation or background, no matter how absurd that may seem.

This book's profundity played a significant role in helping to reframe my perspective for the better. I recommend this book to all, especially those enduring mental hardship.
