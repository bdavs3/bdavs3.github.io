Something I've been thinking about a lot over the last year is goal achievement. Most people have a few particular things they want to get better at. Whether you want to lose weight, learn a new language, or teach yourself to write music, there are a lot of similarities in the journey of improvement. Goal achievement translates to any task, but for me, the biggest lessons in this arena have come from running.

I really enjoy running as a lifestyle sport because I generally think that it has a lot to offer as a metaphor for other things. As a former collegiate track and cross country athlete, I am lucky to have a baseline of fitness that makes going on a jog pretty easy. But there was a time, shortly after college, when I a possessed a bitterness that precluded me from getting out the door to run. I had a rough experience during the last couple years of my time as a college athlete, and as a junior and senior, I wanted nothing more than to be done with my running committment.

The break I took after graduation was nice at first, but pretty soon, I sensed I was missing the foundation that grounded many other parts of my life. Lacking an exercise routine definitely hindered my adjustment to full-time work. Luckily, I had a friend living nearby that was *very* persistent about getting me to run with him. The interesting thing here is that he was much more adamant about making progress and getting better, whereas I was happy to get outside. We quickly made a habit of meeting at 6:05am on the street corner outside my apartment each morning.

I wasn't expecting to enjoy running again, but that's exactly what enabled me to welcome it back into my life. The absence of pressure gave way to a healthy appreciation for the simple joy of the body in motion. And after a couple of months, I was in really good shape again. I reluctantly agreed to start doing some workouts and signing up for races. Unfortunately, Covid prevented those races from happening, but overall, I had already learned a lot about the merits of consistency.

When we are passionate about making something happen, the inclination is often to try to do too much too soon. Passion can lead to burnout, so it's important to be mindful of how you are choosing to balance your approach. Dedicating several hours per day to something can help you make leaps and bounds in the beginning, but is detrimental when end up needing to walk away from something for multiple weeks. I believe the best philosophy is to focus on how *often* you can do something, not how *much*. This is because the most difficult part is usually making the decision to start something. The more days you can do that, the better. And if it's not your day, then be lenient with yourself.

That's why I make my focus getting out the door, not running.
