Last year, I graduated from college and began working full-time. During this time, I also got back into producing electronic music after falling in with a new group of friends who were interested in that sort of thing.

I had started making music as a sophomore in college after googling "how to make dance music." After a year spent in fascination with the craft, I rather abruptly hit what is commonly referred to as "the wall." This was when everything I made started sounding the same, I doubted my own abilities, and became discouraged. Coupled with a growing disillusionment with the music industry, I gave up.

After two years away from music, I met the aforementioned friends, who introduced me to some of the "underground" stuff they listened to. I was immediately smitten with this new musical subculture. It was authentic, exciting, and created mostly by artists that didn't have dollar signs telling them what they should or shouldn't make. To me, this was music in its purest form. At this point, I started fooling around with FL Studio and Serato again, with a much more stoic attitude than before.

I was soon producing stuff that I actually liked listening to. It was contemplative, true to my own experiences, and no longer guided so much by the boundaries of genre.

Working full time meant that a large part of most days couldn't be dedicated to music, which was sometimes aggravating when a particularly intriguing idea popped into my head. But I found that the busier I got, the better my output was at work <em>and</em> at home. I've compiled a few thoughts about being busy and creative below:

- Creativity is like weight training. You need to be persistent over time. Once you break down your creative brain and run out of energy, you'll eventually return with renewed fervor, a little better than before.
- You should try to do a small amount of idea-creating every day, even if just for a few minutes. If you can't actually create them, merely thinking about ideas will still allow your mind to explore interesting thoughts in a way that is conducive to future creative output.
- Organize and optimize your workflow so that the time you spend on things is worthwhile.
- Absorb creativity of all kinds as much as you are able.
- Creativity is just a skill that anyone can learn.
- Not all creators are artists. Artists do create things, but being one is more of a lifestyle.

And if you've made it this far, here's a little bonus..A track I produced that will remain private: [The Curiosity of the Cat](https://soundcloud.com/zbxd/the-curiosity-of-the-cat-original-mix/s-Crp8dgl01VZ). I still don't have anything public, in fact, but I hope to this winter.
