I started this website as a way to hone my modern web development skills after graduating from college last summer. Since I wanted to get used to React, I landed on [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) as the best tool for what I wanted to accomplish. All in all, I am really impressed by the simple, yet elegant, possibilities that this framework offers. I'll definitely be using it again.

Unfortunately, it's pretty hard for a project to serve both as a vessel for learning and as a finished product that satisfies all of the original goals set forth. I ended up spending such a long time creating the [Book Review](/book-review) page that I never quite got to some of the other things I wanted to implement. Ultimately, I decided it'd be best to publish this site, though minimally built out, and take a stab at some of the other things I wanted to get to (music review, portfolio, etc.) in future iterations. Now that I know a lot more about Gatsby, it would be fun to start from the ground up again.
