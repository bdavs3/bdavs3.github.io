People often talk about how the Internet of Things (IoT) will drastically impact how modern society interacts with technology, but they don’t always consider the specific ways that will happen. One reality is that IoT technology should end the scenario where people receive utility bills and feel shocked by the amounts.

Aside from offering metrics that let people see the biggest demands on utilities, some IoT platforms provide suggestions for the most proactive and practical ways to minimize usage in a home. Moreover, utility companies depend on IoT technologies to streamline their business practices, typically saving time and bringing more benefits to customers.

<b>Reducing Energy Expenditures and Greenhouse Gases</b>

A 2016 study by the Consumer Technology Association found increasing automation made possible by energy-savings IoT devices could avoid up to 100 million tons of CO2 emissions and reduce energy consumption in homes by up to 10 percent.

However, the study clarifies the amount of energy saved in a home is greatly dependent on IoT device setup. Then, not surprisingly, the research showed when people use several IoT devices together, their utility-saving payoff is more substantial than only equipping a home with individual devices.

<b>Which Home Utility Upgrades Could Give Significant Advantages?</b>

When people shop for home utility products for energy savings, convenience and other benefits, the kinds they buy largely depend on personal preferences, budgets and their current home setups. Fortunately, there are many possibilities concerning what to buy.

Some smart air conditioners work on a schedule or learn about the typical occupancy levels in a home, then operate accordingly. Also, most connect to apps that facilitate remote usage. That functionality could be particularly helpful if a person forgets to turn off the air conditioner at the house before leaving for a trip.

Additionally, there are smart thermostats people can control with voice commands. One option, the Nest Learning Thermostat, has a leaf icon on the display that shows up when a person chooses an energy-saving temperature. That model, as well as others, automatically switches into a lower-power mode when homes are empty.

If people want to gradually explore how IoT devices could make life more enjoyable and less cost-intensive, they could buy smart light bulbs. The functionality varies depending on the brands people choose, but many have dimmer settings, sync with complementing apps and even change colors to suit the mood.

<b>Using Window Blinds for Favorable Utility Outcomes</b>

Window blinds significantly impact reliance on home utilities, too. Windows can cause energy loss, but during the cooling seasons of the years, more than three-quarters of the sunlight that falls on standard, double-pane windows could become heat. Plus, relying on daylight streaming through large windows minimizes needing to turn on lights and use electricity.

With these things in mind, many companies offer smart window blinds that raise and lower window blinds through smartphone app controls or voice commands. Some intelligent devices turn standard blinds into smart ones, such as the Brunt Blind Engine.

<b>The Various Advantages of Smart Meters</b>

Smart meters are widely available IoT devices that give ongoing statistics of energy usage and may allow customers to track usage and use a pay-as-you-go system that cuts out monthly utility bills.

Aside from making things easier for customers, smart meters have advantages for utility companies. For example, they can manage the bi-directional flows of energy from power grids and make progress on renewable energy projects using the data provided by smart meters. Plus, smart data analysis solutions can monitor grid usage and make relevant suggestions based on fluctuations.

Smart meters for water supplies also have significant advantages for providers, particularly concerning maintenance savings. Analytics apps give proactive information about leaks and other kinds of pipeline failures. Furthermore, the dashboards connected to the smart meters show spikes in usage, potentially alerting companies about necessary upgrades.

Customers benefit from such analytics for utility management, too. In addition to showing in-the-moment details, IoT analytics suites let providers look at usage trends over months or years. The resultant discoveries could guide providers as they roll out services, prevent periodic outages or gauge times of peak usage.

<b>Utility Companies Can Be Slow to Adapt to IoT Technologies</b>

Even as utility company representatives recognize the cost savings and benefits to both their businesses and the customers served, some entities aren’t embracing IoT technologies speedily in all cases. Aging infrastructure is one barrier to adoption. Statistics say 70 percent of the power transformers in the U.S. are more than 25 years old.

It’s also difficult for utility companies to undergo system-wide upgrades if most of the components are outdated. An IoT-powered setup works best when all parts of it communicate with each other and transmit data. So, it can be very costly for a utility company to get fully on board with the IoT, even if its executives agree to make that move.

Also, several security-related risks could become apparent if hackers attempt to infiltrate the systems used by utility companies. Conversely, some IoT-powered technologies continuously screen for unusual activities, alerting technicians to possible breaches before situations get out of control.
