When you wake up from a dream, you realize it is not real.

The real world is input. The machinations of the brain process the input. Consciousness arises as output.

The brain is the machine.

Experience is output.

In the waking world, it is this ceaseless process of stimuli entering the brain and arise as the conscious awareness.

Sometimes we see things we don't want to see. Or hear things we don't want to hear.

But these things arrive

It is input that is consistent with what we understand of the physical laws, and after being processed by the machinations of the human mind, arises as consciousness.

If you have a dream and wake up, you realize that it was not real. "Real" is of course an experience taking place in the physical world.

I often find myself awakening from a pleasant dream thinking something like, "I wish that were real."

Last night, I had a dream that visited a friend's new apartment. We listened to music and made dinner. I chatted with his new roommates.

The events of the dream did not take place in the physical world. The feelings that the dream induced, however, were precisely the same as if it were a lived experience. I felt <b>excited</b> to be in a new part of the city and even <b>anxious</b> while looking for parking.

In dreams more elaborate and absurd, we may experience emotions that are rarely felt in the waking world.

All of this occurs in the brain
