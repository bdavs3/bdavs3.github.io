She loved the protagonist Antoine de Roquentin and his pensive wandering about the French seaside, and that sounded like something I would also be into.\n<br />\n<br />\nMaybe it's because I overdosed on existentialism, but I didn't like this book as much as I thought I would. I typically don't read fiction, but I was interested to read some original material from Sartre. This novel makes a hard attempt at being profound (as does most stuff written by philosophers), and perhaps that not exactly what strikes my fancy. I love profundity as much as the next guy, but I enjoy when it is packaged in clever or subtle ways (this is why I love Paul Murray so much).\n<br />\n<br />\nThere isn't a whole lot that actaully <em>happens</em> in <em>Nausea</em>. It's essentially a long soliloquy in which we hear a great deal about Roquentin's depression and struggle to cope with the absurdity of life. Pretty relatable, but it got old for me. I was diligent in taking notes and outlining important passages for the first half of the book, but after that point, I basically powered through until the end because I was ready to move onto something else.\n<br />\n<br />\nStill, this is probably Sartre's most important work aside from <em>Being and Nothingness</em>, so if you dig existentialism, you'll probably want to give it a read. At 178 pages, it is very bearable. Just remember that this is a translation, was written in 1938, and lacks extensive dialogue, so you won't be able to breeze through it like you would with other books of similar length.\n<br />\n<br />\nFavorite quote:\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>\"I have never had adventures. Things have happened to me, events, incidents, anything you like. But no adventures. It isn't a question of words; I am beginning to understand. There is something to which I clung more than all the rest - without completely realizing it. It wasn't love. Heaven forbid, not glory, not money. It was... I had imagined that at certain times my life could take on a rare and precious quality. There was no need for extraordinary circumstances: all I asked for was a little precision. There is nothing brilliant about my life now: but from time to time, for example, when they play music in the cafes, I look back and tell myself: in old days, in London, Meknes, Tokyo, I have known great moments, I have had adventures. Now I am deprived of this. I have suddenly learned, without any apparent reason, that I have been lying to myself for ten years. And naturally, everything they tell about in books can happen in real life, but not in the same way.

Sarah Bakewell is an excellent biographer, and she manages to adequately cover the lives of several very complex figures in the space of just a few hundred pages.\n<br />\n<br />\nI was immediately hooked when I first read the descriptions of the ways that early existentialists in France would go about their days, hanging out in cafes to debate philosophical ideas and later attending jazz clubs to dance, drink, and chat. At these clubs,\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>"...they would admit anyone \'so long as they were interesting - that is, if they had a book under their arm.\'"</b>\n<br />\n<br />\nThis is all very indie. The existentialists were a creative bunch, constantly reading, writing, making music, and dancing. They were the type of people that you can count on having late-night intellectual talks with. I\'m in. I wanna hang out with these people.\n<br />\n<br />\nAnyhow, this book starts off with Sartre becoming interested in the German idea of phenomenology, which becomes the basis for existentialism. While Plato "puzzles about whether things are real or how we can know anything for certain about them," phenomenology simply asks us to consider things "as they are," or the way in which we experience them. This still allows for a huge degree of complexity: With this perspective, a cup of coffee can be a very phenomenon during each moment of its existence. When it is being carried to you on a tray, you associate it with the feeling of anticipation. When it is steaming, you refrain from bringing it to your lips. When it is nearly empty, you may begin to want more.\n<br />\n<br />\nSartre furthered this idea by describing how the presence of other <em>people</em> affects our experience. Upon being observed, we experience a radical shift in whatever it is that we are doing at the moment. He uses the example of peering through a keyhole into someones room. You might know why you are doing this, but the appearance of an observer forces you to assume all sorts of identities that may or may not be relevant to the truth of what you were doing. W.E.B. Du Bois used a similar idea when describing the struggle of the African American community:\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>"...this sense of always looking at one\'s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one\'s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity."</b>\n<br />\n<br />\nI was most interested in Sartre\'s commentary on Kirkegaard\'s famous idea that "anxiety is the dizziness of freedom." Sartre revolutionized what is meant by the term "freedom." He thought that we tend to create pretend rules in life that give us the illusion of necessity - "guardrails against anguish." (This reminds me of Yuval Harari\'s thesis in Sapiens, which is that humans create inter-subjective "myths" to delude them about their lives\' meaning). Sartre famously said that living in "bad faith" meant that you assume a role and act as if you are trapped in it. That\'s wrong because we possess the ability to make decisions and change our situations.\n<br />\n<br />\nThis might seem absurd, as any reasonable person knows that we all have to deal with all sorts of preexisting conditions that can make life pretty hard and inflexible. Sartre didn\'t deny this. Rather, he said that "good faith" is exercising freedom out of your preexisting situation. Some individuals may be lucky enough for this to mean that their lives are full of choices and devoid of external pressures and constraints. Others not so much. Even a prisoner of war (which Sartre was during WWII) has the freedom with which to react to their situation. Maybe this last point is debatable, but <em>no one can control our internal reactions to external input</em>.\n<br />\n<br />\nI mainly like this idea because it is empowering, and it provides a much better reference point than the traditional schools of philosophy. I\'m tired of trying to figure out whether I\'m real or not. I\'d rather presuppose the elusive nature of reality to be irrelevant to the practical things I can do to improve my life.\n<br />\n<br />\nThis outlook was the most fascinating thing I came across in this book, and I endeavored to learn a bit more about it through one of Sartre\'s novels, <em>Nausea</em>. I\'m not going to go into the rest of the philosophers in this, but there is a lot to be said about each of them - not just their ideas. Bakewell, at the end of the book, says this:\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>"When I first read Sartre and Heidegger, I didn\'t think the details of a philosopher\'s personality or biography were important. This was the orthodox belief in the field at the time, but it also came from my being too young myself to have much sense of history. I intoxicated myself with concepts, without taking account of their relationship to events and to all the odd data of their inventors\' lives. Never mind lives; <em>ideas</em> were the thing. Thirty years later, I have come to the opposite conclusion. Ideas are interesting, but people are vastly more so."</b>\n<br />\n<br />\nWe can\'t detach our ideas from our experience, and to me, that\'s what existentialism is all about. We\'re like play-doh, constantly being pushed and pulled from all sorts of angles, and whatever we are at the moment is result of the entire sequence of those influences. If you read this book, try to consider how each of the philosophers arrived at their conclusions. And try to figure out how you\'ve reached your own conclusions in your life. How can you begin to notice the experiences that shape you? And how can you use this information to gain a broader and more empathetic worldview?\n<br />\n<br />\nRelated books I want to read after reading this one:\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>The Second Sex</b>, by Simone de Beauvoir\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>She Came to Stay</b>, by Simone de Beauvoir\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Being and Nothingness</b>, by Jean-Paul Sartre\n<br />\n<br />\nFavorite quotes from "At the Existentialist Cafe":\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>"Few people will risk their life for such a small thing as raising an arm - yet that is how one\'s powers of resistance are eroded away, and eventually one\'s responsibility and integrity go with them."</b>\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>"She [Beauvoir] would leave the library each afternoon feeling a radiant sense of the rightness in all things - a feeling that lasted for about five minutes before the city\'s grubby reality brought it down."</b>\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>"When he [Merleau-Ponty] looks for his own metaphor to describe how he sees consciousness, he comes up with a beautiful one: consciousness, he suggests, is like a \'fold\' in the world, as though someone had crumpled a piece of cloth to make a little nest or hollow.

Before the main text begins, we read a disclaimer that the book is not about Mormonism. But Mormonism is what Tara's father, Gene, draws upon in any of the instances when he shames Tara for being a whore, denies medical care and education to his children, or blames the government for an array of conspiracies against honest, god-fearing citizens like himself. My instinct is that Tara included this disclaimer not to ironically condemn Mormonism, but rather to separate people like her father from those who don't use faith as an excuse for contemptible or illogical action.\n<br />\n<br />\nMany of us go through life wishing to be different than everyone else so that we can stand out as an icon in a cookie-cutter society. At least I do. Technological advances brought us social media, which does little more than to make us wish we were one of the people that gets endless validation for everything they do. But as for the people doing all the validating... few of them will every stand out. Tara never had to choose to be different. Her circumstances, built on survivalist and extremist foundations, immediately separated her from any other person she could ever hope to meet. This is why her outlook on dance class is interesting to me:\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>\"I loved the sensation of conformity. Learning to dance felt like learning to belong.\"</b>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConformity has never sounded appealing to me, yet somehow it makes sense why Tara's instinct is to want to blend in. Maybe conformity becomes appealing when you begin to notice the drawbacks of being different. For Tara, there was never anything <em>but</em> drawbacks to it.\n<br />\n<br />\nTara's quest to get an education was indeed difficult, but one of the hardest parts about it was having to <em>unlearn</em> the things she had absorbed throughout her corrupted childhood. She attempted again and again to pardon her abusive brother's physical and emotion torture. When she finally reached the \"real world\", she began to wonder if her family was right. At BYU, she met Mormons who weren't genuinely adhering to the strictures of the faith. As a loving individual, she constantly sought signals that her family was correct and that the masses were wrong.\n<br />\n<br />\nI don't believe there are many who can relate to Tara's external environment. But her internal struggle is all too familiar. Whether we know it or not, we constantly try to adapt to incoming information from all kinds of sources. There is an intrinsic bias attached to some of the most prominent of these sources, one of which is family. It is exceedingly difficult to disregard the counsel of family members that have been surrounding you for most of your life.\n<br />\n<br />\nHow do we know what is right and what isn't? At what point do we decide to abandon our trust in our loved ones? These are interesting questions, and as Tara matured and gained exposure to the world, I think she realized that they are intended to be answered internally. Education is the process of discovering your answers to life's difficult questions and learning how to approach them with ever increasing wisdom.\n<br />\n<br />\nIn an interview with Tara that I found on Youtube, she said this:\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>\"An educated person is not someone that can recite an army of facts and knows a lot of things, but rather it is someone that has the flexibility of mind. Someone that is willing to explore her own prejudice and has acquired a depth of understanding that allows her to see the world through another point of view.\"</b>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, I also recently came across the other quote from Vitalik Buterin (the created of the cryptocurrency Ethereum), which strongly reminded me of Tara's:\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>\"Education is ultimately much more than simply memorizing individual facts or even learning individual concepts. What matters most: learning how to think, learning how to reason, and learning how to learn.\"</b>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is this emphasis on process over result that I believe individuals to fully reach their potentials.\n<br />\n<br />\nFavorite quotes from \"Educated\":\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>\"He said he loved me but this was over his head. He couldn't save me. Only I could. I had no idea what he was talking about.\"</b>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>\"'I can stand in this wind [on the roof], because I'm not trying to stand in it,' I said. 'The wind is just wind. You could withstand these gusts on the ground, so you can withstand them in the air. There is no difference. Except the difference you make in your head.\"</b>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>\"But vindication has no power over guilt. No amount of anger or rage directed at others can subdue it, because guilt is never about <em>them</em>. Guilt is the fear of one's own wretchedness. It has nothing to do with other people. I shed my guilt when I accepted my decision on its own terms, without endlessly prosecuting old grievances, without weighing his sins against mine. Without thinking of my father at all, I learned to accept my decision for my own sake, because of me, not because of him.

Author Hans Rosling was putting the finishing touches on this work shortly before he died in 2017. He earnestly wanted to share his insights with humanity before departing, and with the help of son Ola Rosling and daughter-in-law Anna Rosling Ronnlund, was successful in doing so.\n<br />\n<br />\nThe book centers on a set of questions that become the basis for which Hans\'s built the <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/">Gapminder</a> foundation: things like "What is the life expectancy in the world today?" and "Worldwide, 30-year-old men have spent 10 years in school, on average. How many years have women of the same age spent in school?" Even when supplying just three multiple choice options, Hans found that almost everyone he interviewed scored worse-than-random on this assessment. Their answers were indicative of an overly-negative worldview that disparages much of humanity\'s progress in recent years. Remarkably, a person\'s level of education had no correlation with performance.\n<br />\n<br />\nIf you are like me, the first portion of this book should make you somewhat angry. It seems that the author undermines many of the important issues pressing the world today. But, as you go further, you\'ll realize that Rosling\'s fact-based perspective is refreshing. As a trained medical professional, he spent his entire life attempting to help others. He didn\'t hesitate to expose himself to disease or hardship in order to supply aid, and he had an indelible positive impact on a great many communities. In doing so, he learned to resist several "instincts" that distort humans\' ability to think clearly.\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>"They sometimes call my lectures \'inspirtational\' and many people also say they have a comforting effect. This was never my intention. But it\'s logical. What I show is mostly just official UN data."</b>\n<br />\n<br />\nData is definitely Rosling\'s closest ally. It shows that things can be "bad, but still getting better". It reminds us which issues are actually the most important. It can stop us from making horrible, knee-jerk decisions. Data is what reminds us that the world was much, much different as recently as a few decades ago.\n<br />\n<br />\nOne of the flagship viewpoints in <em>Factfulness</em> is that the tendency to group things in a binary fashion ("us" vs. "them", "rich" vs. "poor", "developing" vs. "developed") is not a sustainable habit to take into the future. As such, he divides income into four levels. Well-to-do countries like his native Sweden are largely made up of Level 4 families, but he reminds us that as recently as a few decades ago, Sweden was much more of a Level 3 nation. And before that, Level 2. In the same way that "Western" countries moved up the income levels, so-called "developing" nations are as well.\n<br />\n<br />\nI highly recommend this book, especially if you are trying to educate yourself about today\'s most important global issues. It is a relatively quick read and remains interesting throughout. Towards the end, look out for Rosling\'s Top 5: the things that he thinks could actually lead to doomsday.</p>',frontmatter:{author:"Hans Rosling",coverImage:"book-cover-images/factfulness.jpg",date:"04 October, 2019",tags:["Non-fiction","Humanities","Data","Medicine"],title:"Factfulness",type:"entry"},excerpt:"Factfulness is a book that focuses on the discrepancy between the actual state of the world and how people perceive it.

He describes "flow states" as experiences that involve complete immersion into the present moment. These states sometimes manifest naturally in our lives when we plug away at a task, free of distraction and completely focused on what we are doing. People describe flow states as being free of all anxiety, filled with immense enjoyment, and even associated with a distorted sense of time. M.C. offers that life itself may be thought of as a potential flow experience, capable of providing the type of fulfillment that humans constantly struggle to attain.\n<br />\n<br />\nHumans are capable of absorbing roughly 126 bits of information per second, which could lead to an accumulation of 185 billion bits in an entire lifetime. But, the author points out, many people opt to spend their time in the pursuit of pleasure or the satisfaction of surface-level desires which do not fully challenge their minds to grow and become more "complex". In addition, in moments where they have the opportunity to focus on a task or goal that is meaningful to them, they become distracted by technology, negative thoughts, or a whole array of other things.\n<br />\n<br />\nThe goal of <em>Flow</em> is to underscore how we may go about decreasing "psychic entropy", the result of existential dread that is difficult to mitigate using even the superfluous resources of modern society. Akin to the way a dissipative structure - "a physical system that harnesses energy which would otherwise be dispersed or lost in random motion" (such as a plant, which organizes scattered light rays into useful energy) - creates order out of disarray, our minds can learn to create order out of the haphazard experiences of life.\n<br />\n<br />\nThe idea of flow is extremely powerful to me. It drew me to this book, as I desired to understand more of its facets and figure out how it can be leveraged in my own life. M.C. is adamant that the influence of external factors on the quality of subjective experience can be greatly reduced by individuals with fantastic control over their consciousness. This reminded me of Frankl\'s <em>Man\'s Search for Meaning</em>, from which it is evident that the human mind is capable of prescribing meaning even to horrific events such as the Holocaust. I feel confident in the author\'s supposition that control over the mind\'s processes is a skill - like any other - that can be practiced and perfected. Flow is accessible to anyone, regardless of living situation or background, no matter how absurd that may seem.\n<br />\n<br />\nThere was a small stretch where I was considering labeling this as a two-star book. After the impact of the beginning, where M.C. lays out the framework of his thesis and invites the reader into the world of flow, I got a sense of stagnation for a short while. I had trouble relating to some of the anecdotes about individuals who had managed to find flow in their lives, and I believed M.C. to be disapproving of some things that I would argue can induce flow if received properly. But, just as I was starting to wonder, he pivoted to existentialism and the meaning of life. I felt that he expounded upon these things beautifully, and the book wrapped up in what I felt to be a wonderful way.\n<br />\n<br />\nI read this book during a period of significant struggle, and its profundity played a significant role in helping to reframe my perspective for the better. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone, especially if you are enduring hardship.</p>',frontmatter:{author:"Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi",coverImage:"book-cover-images/flow.jpg",date:"29 September, 2019",tags:["Non-fiction","Psychology","Philosophy","Spirituality"],title:"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience",type:"entry"},excerpt:'In Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (quite the mouthful of a name - I will refer to him as "M.C." hereafter) synthesizes decades of psychological research into what he believes to be a comprehensive theory of happiness.
